The problem: ~xmobar~'s configuration file is *not* (exactly) haskell
code! This makes defining variables, importing other modules, and
reusing code from ~xmonad~ configurations hard.

~xmobarconf~ is my solution. It is a haskell program in which xmobar
configurations can be written in pure haskell, and correctly exported.

Simply edit the ~XMobarConf.hs~ file (it can be copied over from your
old ~xmobarrc~ almost 1-to-1, just make sure to add ~$~ before every
~Run~ command) and make use of all of haskell's features.


*** Install

    After editing the configurations, compile with

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      make
      make install
    #+END_SRC
